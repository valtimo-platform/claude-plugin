 * so a prompt can mix free text with case data:
 *
 * ```
 * Assess {{doc:/question}} for urgency. Customer number: {{pv:customerNumber}}
 * ```
 *
 * Valtimo's own value resolvers do not help here: `PluginService` resolves an action
 * property by splitting the **whole** value on its first `:` to find the prefix, so
 * `pv:foo` works but `text {{pv:foo}} text` never resolves. This class therefore does
 * the interpolation itself and delegates the lookup of each expression to
 * [ValueResolverService].
 *
 * `{{...}}` (not `${...}`) is deliberate: `${...}` already means "Spring Environment
 * property" on plugin *configuration* fields, and reusing it on action fields would
 * give the same syntax two meanings in one plugin.
